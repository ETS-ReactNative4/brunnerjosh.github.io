# Photography
My wife, Kristen, and I try to get away every weekend to explore the beautiful Pacific Northwest. We go on many hikes to see lakes and waterfalls. I love to bring along my Nikon DSLR to capture each memory as it happens. I post my favorite photos on my Flickr account so that I can easily share them with my family back in Hawaii.

Here are several of my most recent photos. [Click here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/77226941@N04/) to view the rest.
