# Professional
Among the many projects that I've worked on at Helpful Human, there are a several that stand out as opportunities where I was able to learn and improve the way I build products.

## Management
While each project deserves its own form of management, the scenarios where I felt the project's chance of success was at its best was when there were daily standups, biweekly retrospectives, and proper planning in place to always keep a backlog full.

I am comfortable with the generic Agile process but I prefer to craft a project's management to the specific needs of the team. In doing so, I feel that team members are able to express the varying ways they think and problem solve.

From my experience, this will often help the leaders of the project to gain a deeper understanding of the problem space &mdash; helping them to make more informed decisions as the project progresses.

## Projects
I am unable to go into great detail of the technologies used and what company it was for, I will provide a high level overview of each project below (sorted from oldest to newest).

### Project 1
This wasn't my very first time working with web technologies, this was the first time I began using a JavaScript framework (Angular) to accomplish MVC-based user interfaces. It was also in this project that I developed a deep understanding and practice of CSS through the Stylus preprocessor.

Since this project was to be run primarily on older web browsers (IE 8) yet still respond to modern devices (phones, tablets, desktop, touch screens, etc.), it provided the perfect opportunity for me to learn responsive web development while accommodating older technologies.

I worked closely with another developer that acted as a mentor to me and I learned the ropes. We were responsible for implementing pixel-perfect designs for the web and print versions of the application.

_**TL;DR** I used Angular to build front-end UI. I learned about browser compatibility, CSS, and the importance of implementing pixel perfect designs._
