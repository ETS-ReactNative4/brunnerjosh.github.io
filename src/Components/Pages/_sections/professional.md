# Professional
Among the many projects that I've worked on at Helpful Human, there are a several that stand out as opportunities where I was able to learn and improve the way I build products.

## Management
While each project deserves its own form of management, the scenarios where I felt the project's chance of success was at its best was when there were daily standups, weekly retrospectives, and proper planning in place to always keep a backlog full.

I am comfortable with the generic Agile process, but I prefer to craft a project's management to the specific needs of the team. In doing so, I feel that team members are able to express the varying ways they think and problem solve.

From my experience, this will often help the leaders of the project to gain a deeper understanding of the problem space which helps them to make more informed decisions as the project progresses.
