        <p class="padding"><strong class="alignLeft blog_header">Week 1</strong><strong class="alignRight">7/2/2014 — 7/13/2014</strong><br><br>Over the past week of work, I have learned a lot about what it looks like to do professional front-end development at a software company. Upon arriving for my first day of work at Helpful Human, I began the process of signing up for all of the online services that we use to manage our workflow. Some of the services we use are<a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>and<a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>. Trello is used to manage the tasks that we have at hand as well as manage things that we would like to work on in the future. In addition, all of the companies passwords and account information are stored there as well. This allows for easy collaboration and accessibility of information amongst the company. We use Slack to communicate as a team because it allows us to tag certain topics as well as post information on articles and projects.<br><br>The work day is very different then what I was expecting when I first began at the company. Since all three of us live North of our location in Seattle, we all meet at 7 AM at the Lynnwood Transit Center. After commuting into work, we go up to our office in the<a href="https://www.wework.com/location/south-lake-union/">WeWork</a>building and set down our belongings. We typically spend 15 minutes unpacking everything and chatting and then we all go down and walk to a local coffee shop for various beverages (to keep us alive — just kidding). What I found really neat about these morning walks was that they allowed us a way to discuss our goals for the day as well as where we were at as a company. Around noon, we typically go for an afternoon walk to grab lunch from the local restaurant. These mid-day walks allow us to keep up-to-date with where we were at in our tasks as well as present any roadblocks preventing us from moving forward. It was neat to see how many times the company to take these breaks to discuss where we were at. I feel that as I move forward with this company, I will feel more and more comfortable with sharing any challenges that I am currently facing.<br><br>Since I am relatively new to front-end development, the company has me doing online courses from two different companies. The first company is<a href="http://www.codecademy.com/learn">Codeacademy</a>and in the first couple of days I breezed through the HTML/CSS courses and towards the end of the week I was already into the JavaScript courses. After I finished with all that Codeacademy had to offer, they signed me up for the second company —<a href="https://www.codeschool.com/">Code School</a>. Code School was great because it forced me to reiterate what I had already learned in JavaScript in a much more in-depth level. Code School's courses had me go through these "road trips" where they presented me with scenarios and had me come up with ways to solve them. Code school uses videos to convey the information that I needed to learn and in these scenarios is where I was able to practice and come up with my own ways of accomplishing a task. One of my coworkers, Nick Glenn, has been helping me throughout my past courses. He has been developing front-end solutions for many years and is very familiar with best practices and alternate ways to accomplish tasks.<br><br>Some of the things that my new boss is asking me to practice involve things like estimating completion time on projects, becoming familiar with JavaScript framework languages like<a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember</a>,<a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular</a>, and<a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>which allow for different modifications of web applications in various ways. I expect to be done with the training necessary for my projects by the end of next week. In addition to the courses I am taking online, I was asked to build a website that allowed me to practice my HTML and CSS skills. After talking with Nick, I felt that I could pair the website creation task as well as the weekly blogging task required for my internship into one. Thus, this blogging site was born.<br><br>Every week I plan to post these updates on what I have been up to, eventually with pictures of the workplace as well as screenshots on the neat things I am working. You can find my contact information to the left hand side of the site. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions at all.<br><br>— Josh Brunner</p>
