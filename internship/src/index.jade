I personally learned quite a bit about web development and all of the facets that go along with it. Most importantly, I learned to deal with situations as they come. Meaning, you can't predict the future and thus need to entertain the now.

Among the topics that I will be discussing in this week's blog post, the primary things are involving the feedback that we got from one of main clients and how when one project stops, another project gets going. I expect this weeks blog post to be shorter than usual simply because the work that we were doing really hasn't changed too much since the last post. I would expect that, as work gets different, the blog post well have to go more in-depth. But for now, here it goes!

In addition, we were also focusing on the on boarding process to bring on our new hire, Cole. It is nice to see that Cole is adapting to our environment quite well! Towards the end of this week we also got feedback from our last project with a specific client and they liked our work and gave us more work for the next round of development. We are currently in the stage of analyzing the different components required in the next step will be to give them a date in which we think we will be able to complete tasks that we determine.

This blog entry will go over some of these changes as well as show you (the reader) some of the neat things that I have been working on, struggling through, and enjoying.

In the previous week, I solved my first software bug and began to get a feel of what it is like to write code in the development industry. I was also told that I needed to develop a tool for a website administrator to be able to edit webpage content without the need to mess with any HTML code.

      //-     a(href='http://jquery.com/') jQuery

There was much discussion around the notion of building a quality product that serves a direct purpose. Some values that I learned about involved building quality products. In order to do this, as a developer, I need to be diligent in my work ethic, honest with myself and the client, as well as responsible with company resources and time.

      //-     | Over the past week of work, I have learned a lot about what it looks like to do professional front-end development at a software company. Upon arriving for my first day of work at Helpful Human, I began the process of signing up for all of the online services that we use to manage our workflow. Some of the services we use are
      //-     a(href='https://trello.com/') Trello
      //-     | and
      //-     a(href='https://slack.com/') Slack
      //-     | . Trello is used to manage the tasks that we have at hand as well as manage things that we would like to work on in the future. In addition, all of the companies passwords and account information are stored there as well. This allows for easy collaboration and accessibility of information amongst the company. We use Slack to communicate as a team because it allows us to tag certain topics as well as post information on articles and projects.
