          <section class="content"><p>In my Operating Systems class (<span class="caps">CSS</span> 430), our homework 2 assignment was to implement process scheduling algorithms on top of the school’s ThreadOS. ThreadOS is a emulated operating system based in Java. It was built by the school to help students conceptualize the operations that go on at the OS-level of the&nbsp;computer.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>In <span class="caps">CSS</span> 422 (Hardware and Computer Organization), I learned a lot about how the physical parts of the computer work closely together to perform operations and commands from the user. The main project that we were tasked with was to build an inverse assembler (also known as a disassembler) which converts a memory image of instructions and data back to 68k assembly language and outputs the disassembled code to the&nbsp;display.</p>
