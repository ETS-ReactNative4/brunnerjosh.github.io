      para1 : "This is my last week as an intern at Helpful Human. After this, I will continue as a Junior developer. I feel like I have really come far with the company and as a web developer. In this report, I will, as usual, go over the past couple of things that I've done this week. In the weeks to come, I will post my last and final reports summarizing the entire internship at Helpful Human.",
      para2 : "<em>Modularity and Speed</em><br>When I started work this week, the first task on our Sprint planning board was to basically reuse some code that I had built in the past to accomplish a specific design. This new design was slightly similar yet slightly different and required some rethinking when I got to it. However, as I got to work in designing it, I realize that you could that I had written the previous week was modularized enough so that all I have to do was make slight changes to my code this time. The result of this was great because we initially estimated that the module would take six hours and it ended up only taking four. This allowed for me to spend two extra hours on something else. This kind of thing ended up happening for quite a few of the cards that I had responsibility for;  meaning that I ended up finishing all of my cards an entire day ahead of schedule. This is great because then I was able to really focus on quality assurance.",
      para3 : "<em>Multiple Devices</em><br>Among the other things I worked on where a few structural changes to some fairly old pages and views both on mobile and desktop. We ended up spending quite a bit of time really digging into the web application that we are building and how it looks and is displayed on a variety of devices. It involves me opening up my emulator, Ryan busting out his old android Smart phone and us both using different browser testing software so that we could nail down each and every bug in our code. As it stands, the project that I've been working on isn't a really good state. There are really only a few more Pages to be flushed out before I think it will go into Final design and specification checks then it gets handed off to the implementation team who will then Connect all of the pages and begin adding data and real content.",
      para4 : "<em>Quality Assurance</em><br>As I mentioned a few weeks back, let me had the QA problem come up and have to be solved, we have been focusing greatly on what gets released to the staging site. Since that incident, we've go through quite a rigorous review of our code where Ryan and I (the two responsible for the project) go over all of the cards in that Sprint and make sure that we document and fix any bugs come up. We ended up finishing the sprint an entire day early leaving us a whole day to devote to cleaning up old, outdated code. This means that our project is now faster, and has less unnecessary CSS and HTML and JavaScript.",
      para5 : "<em>Wrapping Up</em><br>It is really cool to see that the project that I have been working on this entire internship is coming to life in the near future. I think there are only a few more months left in the development stage for this piece of software and then will hit the market. It will be really cool to see something that I have put a lot of effort into being used by a lot of people. Unfortunately, this will likely be my last weekly post because I will now need to focus on writing my reports and getting my presentation ready to go. Because of a scheduling conflict, I will not be presenting my internship until March of 2015 but I will continue to work at a Helpful Human as a Junior developer. I am excited to continue learning and always question what's possible in the web development space because it seems to be ever-growing and boundless. My goal is not to become an expert but a master at development. I aim to always ask questions and always be pushing boundaries.",

    Body : {
      para1 : "This week was more or less the same as the previous weeks. I learned a lot about internal processes and modularity and design. I also got to work on some new components which is always exciting. All in all, I have a good week and feel that my internship has me a lot taught me a lot and as it is coming to an end, it is a bittersweet because it signals the end of my \"intern\" developer stage and a beginning of my \"intermediate\" developer stage.",
      para2 : "<em>Onboarding Definition</em><br>First off, I wanted to discuss something that we learned this week as a company. The on boarding process for a new client and, for that matter a new employee, is an important stage in an employee or client's interactions with a company. And, up until this point, the on boarding process at our company was not so clear. This is not to say that it was bad by any means but this week we realized that it could use some TLC. So, Mark decided that it was time for us to spend some time axing that up and making sure that the documentation was clear so that they could simply be handed off to a new client or employee. I got my chance to spend some time defining what the internal processes look like as well as providing input on various aspects of the company processes.",
      para3 : "<em>Sprint Planning</em><br>I also got an opportunity to sit down with Ryan and plan this next sprint. We were able to go over all of the design documents that were given to us by the designer and break each of the designs into modules. This is good because Ryan has a little bit more skill than I do in the web development space and as we went over things together, we were strategizing and coming up with a plan on how to implement each of the designs completely. We talked about what to do and what not to do and this really helps me understand what needed to be done during this weeks Sprint.",
      para4 : "<em>Component Redesign</em><br>Among the designs that I got the opportunity to implement where in new drop-down menu that had checkboxes and each of these checkboxes needed to be styled a specific way. If you know anything about styling checkboxes in CSS, you know that these can be a bit tricky because you have to play with the <code>:before</code> and <code>:after</code> tags. This required some pretty complex understanding but once I had a basis for creating the element, I seemed to take off with it. The other module that I built was a new, Slightly redesigned, navigation bar that sits at the top of the screen. I worked on the design for the navigation bar on desktop views and Ryan worked on the bar on mobile views.",
      para5 : "In closing, I enjoyed this week as I do most. I continued to refine my skills as a developer as well as find new avenues of learning in the web development space. As always, I'm excited to see what the next, and last, week of my internship has to offer.",

    Title : "Heads Down",
    DateRange : "",
    Body : {
      para1 : "I learned a lot of this week about the importance of making sure that your code is comprehensive. By comprehensive I mean I learns to make sure that I have accounted for different use cases as well as the designers intended purpose of a module. I had to deal with cross browser testing, as well as Mobile device emulators, And even some CSS transitions - Making this is a pretty exciting week.",
      para2 : "<em>Extended Effort</em><br>First off, As I mentioned in the previous post, I was working on a date picker and a time picker. Both of these were supposed to be implemented within eight hours. But, as what typically happens, this and it up taking quite a bit longer. This is alright, because that is just how development works. The complications that cause these modules to take longer than expected had to do with the complexity between the HTML, CSS, and the JavaScript that was building each View as a user requested. Have me known how complex these things would be when we were first estimating the effort, we would have, obviously, given more time.",
      para3 : "<em>Weird Bugs</em><br>Also during this week, I had to deal with some really interesting bugs caused by the many different browsers that this website is supposed to work on. Specifically, one of these big bugs that I had was a weird instance where the content on the screen would be zoomed in drastically when need user was using the website on an iPhone. After hours hours and hours of researching this bug, I learned that Apple requires that input fields on a mobile device have a Font size of 16 pixels and no less. Initially, the font size was 12 pixels, causing the undesired behavior. From this experience, I had to relay this information to the designer who then approved the modified implementation to his designs. This whole experience taught me the intricacies of working on a design that is made for both mobile, tablet, and desktop views.",
      para4 : "<em>CSS Transitions</em><br>When the website is loaded on a mobile device, the screen shows a significantly smaller view of the website. This is typically known as a \"Mobile view\" and is treated quite differently then when a user views a website on a desktop computer. Anyhow, when the web app is loaded on a mobile device, and the user clicks the button in the top left corner to bring me off canvas navigation panel in, a panel should arrive to display alternate pages, settings, and other options. As a perk towards the initial design, we decided that a CSS transition without a nice effect to when the user browses the off-campus navigation. In the current build of the site, we have a 300 ms transition that brings in the off-campus now from the left. And when it closes, it transitions from the right. I can imagine that when the application is finalized, a lot more transitions will be added because it really does make for a nice experience.",
      para5 : "All in all, This week was great. I learned quite a bit about user experience. I also learned about weird bugs caused by different browsers and lastly not to overlook an initial design. I expect the next week to continue to intrigue me as I grow to become a developer in the web space.",

    Body : {
      para1 : "Another week has gone by during my internship and I think it is fair to say that I learned a lot this week. In the previous weeks, it has been encouraging because we had been meeting are Sprint goals which means that we were hitting our target. However, this week, due to quite a few different variables, We were unable to meet mark. While this is understandable, it still does not feel good and even though we got a lot of work done, I really wanted to finish up the task that I was working on.",
      para2 : "<em>Missing Our Goals</em><br>As I mentioned above, we did not meet our goals for the Sprint. Some of the variables that came into play which pushed our allotted time was a couple of scope changes in the design specifications from the client. This, while expected, ended up costing an additional three hours of work to get done. And then, after we had assigned an expected time frame on a couple of the tasks, the tasks and it up taking quite a bit longer to complete. Even though the Sprint is technically complete, Some of these tasks are still not completed.",
      para3 : "<em>Company Focus</em><br>On a more positive note, on Wednesday Mark brought all of us into a meeting room to discuss the company's status and direction. This is Nice because I was reassured that I am working for company that I really enjoy. I am fascinated by the fact that our boss can take time out of his busy day to encourage us each individually as well as be transparent on where he wants the company to go. I want to continue working for this company because I believe in the statement of purpose which is to create useful products that people love.",
      para4 : "<em>Date and Time Pickers</em><br>Demanding that I was working on this week was delving more in to the functional components of a web development. This means that I was primarily working in JavaScript which is what I really like to do. I enjoying working in JavaScript because the primary coding that I have had experience with in school has been logic based. Even though JavaScript does not allow pointers and some of the more fundamental aspects of a programming language, it does offer quite a few useful tools along the way. I got and a lot of experience in building a date picker as well as a time picker. Basically, both of these pickers Drop down when a special button is clicked. The user is then able to set a specific date and time for something. Then, I have to use angular to tie up the variable that is getting set so that it can be persisted. All of this is very complicated and when I went to actually do the stylings for it, I really had an interesting time making that work. This, unfortunately, is one of the things that did not get completed this week. I am positive that it will be finalized next week but that means that it is getting pushed into another Sprint.",
      para5 : "As mentioned in the above post, this week wasn't learning wait for me. I'm than that it's okay to fail and have work that should've gotten done be pushed back because that is how development works. We never can truly estimate how long something will take us. Sometimes, you just have to \"go with the flow\" and do it you can. But I'm working hard not to do is to Bring work home. Because, with the nature of this type of work, it is so easy to do. This is can, however, be dangerous because once you start letting your professional life into your personal life, you can easily let it take over.",

      para1 : "This week was an interesting week because we, as a company, had to learn some new lessons. I personally learned quite a bit about web development and all of the facets that go along with it. Most importantly, I learned to deal with situations as they come. Meaning, you can't predict the future and thus need to entertain the now.",
      para2 : "<em>More Functionality</em><br>One of the things that I notice that I was doing this last week was working mostly on the functional aspects of the web application. This means that I was writing and working in a lot of JavaScript code. While I still primarily was doing HTML and CSS, like usual, it did feel nice to actually get down and work some real logic into the workflow of a potential user. One of the really cool things that I ended up finishing on Friday was having the user be able to simulate and upload of an attachment. This is really cool because I was able to create a attachment array and be able to load attachments from that and add/delete uploaded attachments. This required me to work and Angular's directives passing around objects, etc.",
      para3 : "<em>Calendar Dropdown</em><br>I also began working on styling a calendar date selection drop-down menu. This is going to take probably another four hours to complete, so you will likely hear more about this next week. At this point, it was mostly styles (which are very complicated). Next week, I imagine that I will be doing mostly the functional side of selecting a date from a calendar.",
      para4 : "<em>Bugs! Squish them!</em><br>This past week, I also received feedback from our client about different bugs that we had in our code. This, while expected, does not necessarily feel the best because I like to be sure that what I am pushing out is professional and finished. So, this is a learning lesson for me in performing more testing. The bug that I had to worry about, was a small one. It dealt mostly with how a bar is displayed on a desktop and how it \"breaks\" on a tablet. I fixed it in 15 minutes and was able to move on easily.",
      para5 : "<em>Browser Testing</em><br>While we were receiving feedback from our client, they brought up some screenshots that they had when our web app was loaded into Internet Explorer. It is completely broken. This came to us as a shock because we have been developing the web app on Google's Chrome web browser. This experience caused us to dig further into researching what web browsers are app currently did work in. We observed that it only works in the latest Versions of all the web browsers. Especially Internet Explorer, Version 8 through nine, it is completely unusable. This is a problem because the web app that we are building is to be used in the medical industry which 95% of runs on Internet Explorer 8 eight and nine.",
      para6 : "<em>Continuous Integration</em><br>This experience caused us to begin formulating a Continuous Integration (CI) Manifest. With this Manifest, it will act as a guideline to how we at Helpful Human do testing before completing client work. Our goal is for this problem to not happen again. Ever.",
      para7 : "All in all, I learned a lot this week. It was a good one for me to experience what it's like to be doing something that you think was the right way and then find out that it was not. I learned from this and expect that in the coming weeks I well become more and more apt to this new CI way of doing things.					<br><br>",

      para1 : "This week I was really focusing on getting as much work done as possible because they client I am doing all of my projects for is trying to me and upcoming deadlines before the year ends. So, I got a good glimpse of what it looks like to start getting pressure to get work done to meet client expectations.",
      para2 : "<em>Full Page Designs</em><br>One of the things I was very excited to be working on this week was doing complete page designs for clients. This includes looking at a Photoshop file and deciding how the page should work in terms of HTML implementation. This kind of stuff is cool because it allows me to think creatively in a situation and actually get to build it and watch it actually work. This job did not only require HTML coding, But it also required me to style it with CSS. Some of the really cool aspects of doing this work is building what is called \"responsive designs.\" A responsive design means a design that will respond to the screen resolution that the website is currently loaded on. Per the client request, we are designing this web application to work on desktop I'm a tablet, and mobile phone screen sizes. I'm able to target these different screen sizes based on a neat thing called a media query. Media queries essentially go out and fetch the resolution of the screen from the browser and return any value. With this value, I run it through a function which determines what category the web app should should load.",
      para3 : "<em>Filter Dropdown Selector</em><br>Another cool thing that I was working on for one of the pages was what I coined a \"filter drop-down selector.\" This was just a fancy term for a drop-down menu that had to have functionality attached to it. Because of the pressing time constraints, I did not have as much access to senior level knowledge as I normally do. Thus, I had to figure out how to make this happen on my own. In this, I was able to gain a lot of expertise in making drop downs happened. I ran into different issues along the way. One of the issues that I ran into was when you click the button to show the drop-down menu and regardless of whether you click within the drop down menu or out of the drop-down menu, the menu would disappear. This was not the desired functionality and required me to dig further into Learning why it was happening and how to prevent it. Well, after a few hours of searching, I discovered a neat little function call that prevents something from being registered with the DOM. Meaning, I can prevent unwanted functionality when I need to. The function call was <code>stopPropagation()</code>. After using this, my problem was solved and I was able to mark the \"filter drop-down selector\" complete.",
      para4 : "<em>Big Project</em><br>In last week's update, I mentioned that I had began a scratch page for the client to be able to pick and grab certain elements when they please. Well, this week I am ended up spending 18 hours wrapping that project up. It was quite a task and I learned a lot about modularity and functionality implementation. As I mentioned in last weeks update, I was working on a typeahead selector. Well, after further testing I discovered that I had a bug in my typeahead selector causing unwanted functionality. I handed up being able to fix this by rewriting an internal JavaScript function which allowed for proper selection and deletion of items in a list.",

      para1 : "Over the past week, I got a lot of experience with working with the client as I created new modules. I also got the experience at creating something brand new for production. For the majority, I got a lot of the same interactions as I have in the previous weeks.",
      para2 : "<em>Speeding up the Sprint</em><br>First off, when we got into work on Monday and had our team meeting, Mark let us know that our main client has requested that we fit all of the work we would normally do in a two weeks Sprint into a one-week sprint from now on. This means that, where we had 70 hours of work to fit into two weeks...we now have 1 1/2 weeks to complete it. This is great for the business because this means that the client wants us to be working faster and is able to take us for more hours per week. However, at this point, in order to fill the hours required in other tasks, we are going to need to bring on a new person. It will be interesting to see how this new request from the client affects the rest of our team's structure and practice.",
      para3 : "<em>Working Remotely</em><br>I also wanted to touch a little bit about my experience with working remotely. I wanted to focus on how it can be both a benefit and a disadvantage at the same time. It is a benefit because I am able to focus on nothing but the tasks at hand. At work, sometimes you can get distracted and you may not be as productive as you would have normally. But, when I am at home, or in an office remotely, I am pretty good at keeping on task. I say it is also a hindrance because when I run into problems that I face, it is a little bit harder for me to find a solution. Normally, in the office, I could simply turn around and ask one of the more experienced developers. But when I am working from home, I am forced to find solutions on my own. This is both good and bad because I tend to learn better when I have to problem solve my way through things. But, this way normally takes me longer.",
      para4 : "<em>Taking over Pages</em><br>As I continue to work on the same client's project, I am getting more and more familiar with the code base. This, inherently, needs me to being a much more productive developer than I was when I first started. I feel like I know the code base very well and I am learning to manage it and maintain it all along the way. Over the past week, I have come to a realization about how my work is being partitioned onto the project. I realize that I am actually taking entire pages over rather than small modules. This is a good sign that I am doing good work and work worth value. I'm excited to be doing this and I look forward to continuing this as I learn more and more about web development.",
      para5 : "<em>Typeahead Selector</em><br>Lastly, I wanted to share my excitement about the piece that I made yesterday for one of the pages. The client is having me make a scratch page so that they can pick and choose modules to place in various locations on the website. I have spent quite a bit of time lately on this scratch page and one of the last components that I needed to build was what is called a Typeahead. Basically, when you type text into an input field, the Typeahead code guesses what you are trying to type and provides a suggestion for you to simply select from. The part that I had to create from scratch was when you select one of these suggestions, your selection gets added to a list of your previous suggestions. After I had created this functionality I also had to create the ability to delete from this list. All along the way, I had to be thinking about a user's security and what kind of invalid inputs users might try to do. It was neat to be able to directly code using the knowledge that I have learned in school.",
      para6 : "All in all, it was a great week and I feel like I progressed on my path to becoming a web developer. I am excited for the next week of work because I will be finishing the scratch page as well as starting on brand-new pages for this client. Stay tuned!",

It is neat to see that the level of trust that I have gained at Helpful Human has earned me the ability to communicate with clients on projects directly. This is also neat because I am able to have my questions answered almost immediately when they arise rather than having to submit a help request and getting answered at a much later date. My experience so far with me kidding directly with clients has been pleasant. I am able to shut sure my code much more effectively when I understand clearly how it will be used.",
      para3 : "<em>Full Cycle of Work</em><br>Also, since last time that I wrote, I have gone through a full cycle of estimating effort required for work and completing. In my last blog post I had a lot of discussion on what it means to estimate effort effectively. In my first attempt at estimating effort required to do a job, by under estimated the effort required and overestimated my capability to complete the work. This is something that Mark (our boss) stresses to us often because this is something that he has found developers do a lot. The way we prevent over estimation and under capability is bye listing out items to get completed really on a card in Trello that has acceptance criteria and all related documents in one place. This allows us to go over each module piece by piece and add time to it. I could easily see that if I do this enough, I will get a great understanding of how long it takes me to do work.",
      para4 : "<em>Defects in my Code</em><br>After submitting my last work with the client, I loaded up the website on my iPhone and was shocked at what I saw. What I had purposefully tested on a browser which emulates an iPhone worked fine. However, when I loaded it up on the real thing, it was broken. This is something that we have since added as a defect and will need to be investigated further at a later date. What I learned from this is that you cannot always trust me browser's emulation tool. Therefore, it is always important to actually test the code on A physical device at some point.",

It was tough, and we had quite a few bugs to sift through, but we did it. We sent that off to the client for final review before it gets approved and now we are working on the next round of work from this client. During the meeting that I went to last week, the designer give us a preview of the new work that was going to be sent to us in the coming days. Now that we are in a new week, we have received the Photoshop files for us to begin implementation off of. On Monday, we reviewed these files as a team and assessed the effort it would take (in hours) to complete the tasks at hand. Once we have that, we informed the client and got right to work. Towards the end of the week, we realized that our time estimates were about 40% off consistently. For example, if we said something would take 10 hours, in reality, it took us 14 hours to complete. As mentioned in my previous reports, estimating the amount of effort is something that I am working towards getting better at. Mark S. always says that we wanted to get better and better at estimating the amount of effort required so that we can better understand how we as developers get work done. This was a good lesson for me in understanding how I need to get better at looking at the intricate details in the Photoshop files so that I can properly give accurate estimates.",

      para2 : "<em>Presenting my Work</em><br>First of all, on Monday at work, I was sitting at my desk when my boss arrived and informed me that I would be going to a meeting with the client that we've been doing work for for quite some time. At first, I was a bit nervous because this time I would be going to a meeting with a client that I had actually done work for. During my first couple of weeks, I had gone to a meeting with a different client for a different project that I had nothing to do with other than the fact that I worked in the same room as the developer that did. The purpose of that meeting was primarily for me to see what it's like interacting with clients during meetings. This time, however, I was the one that was doing the work and it was my turn to present my work. Fortunately, I was accidentally prepared to do so since I had brought my computer and had all of the development tools up and ready to present with. I hooked my computer up to their monitor to show it all off on the big screen. I presented to the lead of development as well as the designer. Both were impressed with the work I had done and had plenty of questions for me during the presentation.",
      para3 : "<em>De&#8212;Bootstrapping</em><br>Once we had gotten back to the office, it was clear to me that the client needed the functional aspect of the site working ASAP &#8212; because, if you think about it, what's the point of a pretty website if it doesn't work? So ,when we did get back to the office, Mark P. and I got right to work. The work we were focusing on involved stripping the Bootstrap-Angular components and de-Bootstrapping them. The value in this is that, once completed, your code base no longer relies on external JavaScript functionality and stylings. Also, it's shorter and easier to manage on larger scale. Towards the end of the week of development on this project, we ran into a really weird bug causing modals to act undesirably. We ended up getting three developers trying to solve it for a whole hour. Finally, at the end of the day, we figured it out; This meant that the project was now complete! We quickly uploaded our profess to the staging site (for the client to see)  and we sent out an email letting them know.",

I've been a part of 2 or 3 different interviews so far this week. It seems like a weekly thing now, but these interviews show me something. They show me that Helpful Human is somewhere that other want to come. It's neat to see that the company is doing so well that others are wanting a piece of the action &#8212; but I was first! :)",
      para5 : "All in all, this was a great week. I got to experience things that put me slightly out of my comfort zone &#8212; causing me to grow as a developer. I got experience in learning what it's like to de-Bootstrap-ify a code-base as well as work alongside 2 other developers in a bug-solving triage.

      para2 : "<em>Then there were 3 (developers)</em><br>So first off, I want to talk about the sad news that I got this week. During our Wednesday meeting, Mark S. announced that Mark P. has taken a job at another company. This came to me as a surprise because Mark and I have been working on all of the past projects together and it makes me somewhat nervous to see how I'm going to complete the projects from here going forward. Mark S. assure me that he is working diligently to bring on another one or two front-end developers to continue Helpful Human's growth. I suggested that we bring on Cole because he is excelling quite quickly with his backend schooling and I think that if I am able to spend a day or two teaching him front end stuff, I could have him up and running in no time. Mark said that he would have to think about that but I would not be surprised if that is what turns out to be. What I learned from this experience was how important each developer is in such a small workplace environment. And when one developer decides to move on to another opportunity, it can make the company culture seem shifted. Now, I do not doubt that we will exceed just fine, but I do expect there to be a little bit of reorganization necessary in order to move forward.",
      para3 : "Now to the exciting part. After our company had the meeting where we discussed Mark's leaving and A couple of there various procedural updates each of us got to work. With us being on hold with the client's backlog, it allowed me to discuss with Mark about what I could be doing in the interim. We both decided that I should begin learning about Apple's new Swift programming language. You can learn more about it <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/swift/\">here!</a> I am taking an online course through a company called Bitfountain. You can learn more about that course <a href=\"http://bitfountain.io/course/complete-ios8/\">here!</a> It is exciting to be going through this course because I am able to easily apply the object-oriented programming methodologies that I have learned in my UW course degree to it. It is nice to be able to actively use the skills that I've taught myself in such a real context. I have already made to different (very basic) apps to work on the iPhone 5S. I am extremely excited to continue working on this project as time allows!",
      para4 : "<em>Super Swift-y</em><br>On Thursday, we got the go-ahead from our client that had us on hold. So, we spent the majority of the day getting all set up with that project again. The best way that I've been able to mentally think about the process of getting set up in client work, is what is known as \"context switching.\" Context switching is a computer science term for when the computers processor has to replace its register data with another processes information. You can read more about that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_switch\">here.</a> It always amazes me how long it takes to simply set up A project for a client. However it even more so amazes me how long it takes to get back into a project after a substantial time has passed since the last at work on it. Once we were able to get everything up and running again, Mark P. and I were able to dive into the Angular programming side of this clients web application. This involves working with JavaScript, CoffeeScript, and creating Angular directives and controllers. We spent the majority of the afternoon troubleshooting different bugs that came up as we worked on linking up the interface of the web app. Going forward, I think we have finally figured out what needs to happen as we build the Angular components and this should result in easier work.",

I found out some bad news about one of our coworkers deciding to move to a different company however I also have the opportunity to begin my training in Swift programming. I'm excited to continue my learning as well as my development in the company. The client has requested that we come down to their office in the next week to do some in-house development work. So, this should be an interesting experience for me as I have never done something like this.

As we arrived on Monday morning, be all checked our e-mails, as per the normal \"Monday morning tasks\" require. Immediately, we looked in our inbox and saw that we had received the new designs for the version 2 edition of the website that we had been working on. After looking through the new designs, I realized that a component that I had designed (I had called it the az-bar) was missing. Sure enough, it had been removed from further production. Now, since we are getting paid for the work we are doing, this doesn't matter too much. However, never before had I been through this type of circumstance; something that I had put a lot of effort in design to was, for all intensive purposes, trashed.",

Both of them advised me that they had had work that they were proud of get, essentially, thrown away. They acknowledged how it makes you, as the developer, feel and advised that I don't let it get to me. They also suggested that I don't let myself become too attached to any one product that I create. The reason for this is because sometimes you won't have the final say in what gets released and what doesn't. After our discussion, I felt a lot better and a lot more understanding about the whole situation.",

As Mark walked into the office on Wednesday, one of the first things he said was to stop all work on this client's backlog. After a call from the client in regards to a recent invoice, there were some discrepancies with what was billed.

This kind of thing, apparently, used to happen quite often before standards were put in place to prevent it. The code base that we were handed when we took this new client's work on exemplifies this exact \"spaghetti code\" mess. Nevertheless, I am making my way through it with Mark P. We've been able to add functionality and clean up certain sections of this spaghetti code so that working with it in the future should be easier.",

Full-stack projects include every aspect of web development (hosting, databases, business logic, API layer, UI design, and UX design). A full-stack developer is capable of understanding exactly what is necessary to complete a project and this is what they are training me to do. So, in order to do so, Nick assigned me my first task. My first task was to figure out why the admin box was not checked even though the admin was signed. After 45 minutes of debugging and tracing back why it was not happening, I learned that I needed to use my knowledge of how an Angular can quickly look up information on the currently logged in user. The specific piece of code that I needed to add was <code>{{user.admin}}</code>, which returned a <code>1</code> if the user was an admin and a <code>0</code> if the user was not. Then, in the HTML input tag, I placed a piece of code that would show/hide the checkmark depending on who was signed in. Once I had solved this bug, I felt like a champ.

We discussed things like what kind of projects we wanted to work on as a team as well as a discussion on habits. The discussion on habits was interesting because we basically listed out the things that we, developers, do and how they can be either good or bad. Some of the things that came up were things like sitting down for too long or responding to emails in the middle of a project. While both of these things can be seen as good or bad, we decided that as a team we should set some guidelines going forward. One of the things that we decided was that when an e-mail comes in, we should let it sit in the inbox until our next \"scheduled\" break. Many of the bad habits that our team discussed can be managed by using a technique that tends to and able high productivity in teams.

      para5 : "<em class=\"subsection\">The design handoff</em><br>On Friday, we went for a walk to one of our client's office spaces to have an \"official\" design handoff. This was something that I had never done before. It was not so much intimidating as it was interesting to me as an entry-level developer. What this design handoff included was me, Nick, and Mark meeting with three different project managers that we're in charge of working directly with us (Helpful Human) and the client that is paying for it all. The people that we met with work for a company (which I am not allowed to say for privacy reasons) who hired Helpful Human to design a full-stack website for one of their clients. The meeting involved us going over the wireframes that were produced by this design firm and it was our job to make sure that what the firm had designed was actually doable with respect to time and budget. The meeting went on for 2 1/2 hours and we discussed everything on the wireframes as well as what kind of possibilities might be out there for V2 of the website.",
      para6 : "Overall, I was very satisfied with the progress that I made this week as a developer. Not only did I complete my training but I solved bugs and made actual contributions to one of the projects that we are working on at Helpful Human. I am excited to start working this next week on more things involving this project.",

      para1 : "I learned a bit about the companies values this week. Primarily, during one of our meetings when we were discussing a project that we might begin to work on as a team. There was much discussion around the notion of building a quality product that serves a direct purpose. Some values that I learned about involved building quality products. In order to do this, as a developer, I need to be diligent in my work ethic, honest with myself and the client, as well as responsible with company resources and time.",
      para2 : "<em class=\"subsection\">Training</em><br>I was expecting to be completely done with all of my training this week, however, I think I have another day or two to go. While I did complete the training that I understood I needed as of last week, as I progressed throughout my courses, I learned that I needed to learn a few more languages. This next week will be focusing on me getting started on a couple of the projects that we have been discussing as a team.",
      para3 : "<em class=\"subsection\">Internal Projects</em><br>The projects that we are thinking that I will work on will either be a project for one of the companies that has hired us to make some changes on their website or the project will be to begin work on our internal projects. For the sake of non-disclosure agreements, I am not able to list off the company names that we are working with. Nevertheless, I do expect this next week to be quite interesting as I transition from training into actual work towards a designated purpose.",
      para4 : "<em class=\"subsection\">Company Growth</em><br>Another thing that I was a part of was an interview for one of my colleagues in the degree. After working with him for two quarters now, and gaining a better understanding of how the Helpful Human operates, I felt that my colleague would be a fine addition to our team at Helpful Human. Mark brought my colleague in for an interview and it was very interesting be in the position of the interviewer rather than the interviewee. It was interesting because I was not under the pressure of time in answering the interview questions. Rather, I was able to slowly process the information as well as be an active participant in the group discussion.",
      para5 : "I was also part of a phone conference for acceptance testing on a product Helpful Human recently completed. It was interesting to see how many different people needed to be a part of such a seemingly simple task. I learned that investors, testers, project managers, technical teams, developers, and such, all need to be in on one conference call. We used <a href=\"https://www.join.me/\">Join.me</a> to watch the screen of the project manager as she stepped through the web application that Helpful Human built. Once the product was accepted, we hung up and had a retrospective on what went well and what could have gone better.",
      para6 : "<em class=\"subsection\">Communication</em><br>Going through another week of work at Helpful Human and experiencing the open communication environment that is encouraged by the owner, Mark Sandeno, I am reminded of a similar experience in that of a company that I am currently observing in my research class, CSS 499. More specifically, the company that I am researching, BeamCoffer, does thrice daily \"huddles\" to allow for the developers to be on the same level as the team progresses through the daily tasks.",
      para7 : "<em><small>Similarities</small></em><br>The open discussion environment exhibited by Helpful Human and BeamCoffer seem to encourage group learning and group discussion. The value in this seems to be that everyone can be on the same page throughout the course of the day. This kind of interaction prevents developer time being \"wasted\" on projects that are not necessary or projects that have lower importance in the backlog of tasks.",
      para8 : "<em><small>Differences</small></em><br>Both companies have these open discussions amongst the team of developers, managers, testers, etc. However, the environment in which these discussions occur differs drastically. At BeamCoffer, the meetings are split up into three different segments during the day. There is a structured way that the discussion ensues and a level of hierarchy as to where the leadership makes decisions. There are formalized techniques they use to lead the discussion and specific methods they use to record the topics. One of these methods involves using a physical whiteboard to post and updates company values/thoughts/motives/backlogs/etc. as a team.",
      para9 : "At Helpful Human, we typically have two meetings. One meeting in the morning and one in the afternoon. The morning meeting is done as we walk to a nearby coffeehouse. Along the way, we discuss our daily goals and where we are at in our current project. The afternoon meeting is typically a discussion as we get lunch to, once again, discuss our goals and where we are at in our current projects. Since all three of us live up in Edmonds, Mukilteo, and Snohomish, we all meet at the <a href=\"http://www.soundtransit.org/Rider-Guide/Lynnwood-TC-PR\">Lynwood Transit Center</a> to commute together. Both the commute into Seattle, which is where our office is, as well as our commute back up into Lynnwood are more opportunities for us to conduct conversation around the company's needs.",

    DateRange : "",
    Body : {
      para1: "Over the past week of work, I have learned a lot about what it looks like to do professional front-end development at a software company. Upon arriving for my first day of work at Helpful Human, I began the process of signing up for all of the online services that we use to manage our workflow. Some of the services we use are <a href=\"https://trello.com/\">Trello</a> and <a href=\"https://slack.com/\">Slack</a>. Trello is used to manage the tasks that we have at hand as well as manage things that we would like to work on in the future. In addition, all of the companies passwords and account information are stored there as well. This allows for easy collaboration and accessibility of information amongst the company. We use Slack to communicate as a team because it allows us to tag certain topics as well as post information on articles and projects.",
      para2: "The work day is very different then what I was expecting when I first began at the company. Since all three of us live North of our location in Seattle, we all meet at 7 AM at the Lynnwood Transit Center. After commuting into work, we go up to our office in the <a href=\"https://www.wework.com/location/south-lake-union/\">WeWork</a> building and set down our belongings. We typically spend 15 minutes unpacking everything and chatting and then we all go down and walk to a local coffee shop for various beverages (to keep us alive &#8212; just kidding). What I found really neat about these morning walks was that they allowed us a way to discuss our goals for the day as well as where we were at as a company. Around noon, we typically go for an afternoon walk to grab lunch from the local restaurant. These mid-day walks allow us to keep up-to-date with where we were at in our tasks as well as present any roadblocks preventing us from moving forward. It was neat to see how many times the company to take these breaks to discuss where we were at. I feel that as I move forward with this company, I will feel more and more comfortable with sharing any challenges that I am currently facing.",
  		para3: "Since I am relatively new to front-end development, the company has me doing online courses from two different companies. The first company is <a href=\"http://www.codecademy.com/learn\">Codeacademy</a> and in the first couple of days I breezed through the HTML/CSS courses and towards the end of the week I was already into the JavaScript courses. After I finished with all that Codeacademy had to offer, they signed me up for the second company &#8212; <a href=\"https://www.codeschool.com/\">Code School</a>. Code School was great because it forced me to reiterate what I had already learned in JavaScript in a much more in-depth level. Code School's courses had me go through these \"road trips\" where they presented me with scenarios and had me come up with ways to solve them. Code school uses videos to convey the information that I needed to learn and in these scenarios is where I was able to practice and come up with my own ways of accomplishing a task. One of my coworkers, Nick Glenn, has been helping me throughout my past courses. He has been developing front-end solutions for many years and is very familiar with best practices and alternate ways to accomplish tasks.",
      para4: "Some of the things that my new boss is asking me to practice involve things like estimating completion time on projects, becoming familiar with JavaScript framework languages like <a href=\"http://emberjs.com/\">Ember</a>, <a href=\"https://angularjs.org/\">Angular</a>, and <a href=\"http://coffeescript.org/\">CoffeeScript</a> which allow for different modifications of web applications in various ways. I expect to be done with the training necessary for my projects by the end of next week. In addition to the courses I am taking online, I was asked to build a website that allowed me to practice my HTML and CSS skills. After talking with Nick, I felt that I could pair the website creation task as well as the weekly blogging task required for my internship into one. Thus, this blogging site was born.",
  		para5: "Every week I plan to post these updates on what I have been up to, eventually with pictures of the workplace as well as screenshots on the neat things I am working. You can find my contact information to the left hand side of the site. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions at all.",
